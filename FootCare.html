              &nbsp;Feet are your body’s foundation, so keeping them healthy is vital to your overall health. Years of wear and tear can be hard on your feet. Overuse, shoes that don’t fit properly and even genetics can lead to injuries and disorders of the foot that can greatly impact your mobility. Aside from some foot issues becoming incredibly painful, they can also make you more susceptible to accidents. You risk falling if foot issues persist. 
              Walking awkwardly to avoid that pain sets you off-balance and heightens your risk of hurting yourself further.

                    One factor that we should talk about regarding this is the thickness of the hair. 
                    Women with thicker hair may need less frequent haircuts, as thicker hair tends to be stronger and breakage can happen less. 
                    Women with thinner hair, however, may need to get a haircut more often.</p>
