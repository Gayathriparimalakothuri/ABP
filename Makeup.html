              &nbsp; Makeup can be used to highlight your natural features and enhance your beauty. It can help accentuate your eyes, make your lips look fuller, and give your skin a smooth and even appearance.

              Gives us the confidence
              Every woman is indeed beautiful despite makeup. What makeup does is that it adds to your beauty? It also helps to hide the little flaws and even out your complexion. 
              
              You might feel bad about certain things on your face, and they might bother you. When talking to a person, you may keep wondering if they are looking at your pimple. 
              
              All makeup does is give you the extra push, and you can go take over the world with this confidence.
